# One-way-and-two-way-ANOVA-Part-I-
Throughout the following exercises, you will learn to use Python to run both a one-way and two-way ANOVA test. You'll also learn to run a post hoc test to analyze the results of a one-way ANOVA test. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly recommend watching the video lecture and completing the IVQ for the associated topics.

Recall the following definitions:

* **One-way ANOVA**: Compares the means of one continuous dependent variable based on three or more groups of one categorical variable.
* **Two-way ANOVA**: Compares the means of one continuous dependent variable based on three or more groups of two categorical variables.
All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place within this notebook.

As we move forward, you can find instructions on how to install required libraries as they arise in this notebook. Before we begin with the exercises and analyzing the data, we need to import all libraries and extensions required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will be using pandas and statsmodels for operations, and seaborn for plotting.
